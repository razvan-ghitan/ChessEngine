## Foreword
This project was indeed a homework on our 2nd year at ACS, UPB at Algorithm Design discipline in which we were asked to make a 3 Check Chess Bot by using the XBoard platform for inputs and testing. We gathered ourselves and created this team for taking over the challenge.

## Technologies used
  - At the begining of the project, we were asked to choose between `C++` and `Java` as our desired language. The result was, of course, the one we managed to get a taste of during our freshman year and worked until that moment. The winner between these two was `Java`.
  - During the implementation, we encountered some of the most important features of chess engines, such as `m-WAY Search Trees` and `Alpha-Beta Pruning`.

## Description
The homework was divided into 3 stages of sprint implementation and at the end there was a contest between all of our bots and also against a very capable one, implemented by the team of Algorithm Design, using AI. Ours did pretty well, scoring 1.15/2 overall.

This is our project, with details about every stage's implementation:
  - `Phase 1/`: Getting used to XBoard platform whilist analysing the input from the engine and correctly moving a pawn across the board.
  - `Phase 2/`: Implementing all legal moves for every piece, alongside the 3 Check rule, En Passant, Mate and Stalemate.
  - `Phase 3/`: Choosing an advanced algorithm to increase the quality of the moves and implementing the specific heuristics.
